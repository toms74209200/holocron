## Workflow

- **Before starting work**: Run `gh atat pull` to sync TODO.md with GitHub Issues
- **When creating a PR**: Always link the related issue
  - Use `gh pr create` with issue reference in body: `Closes #<issue_number>`
  - Example: `gh pr create --title "Implement feature" --body "Closes #1"`
- **After merging PR**: The linked issue will automatically close
- **When updating TODO.md**: Run `gh atat push` to sync changes to GitHub Issues

## Architecture Verification Workflow

When using server-architecture guidelines or writing new code:

### 1. Verify Guidelines Against Codebase
- Read the architecture guidelines
- Survey existing codebase to understand how each layer is implemented:
  - Review entire directory structure to identify which layer each belongs to
  - Extract implementation patterns (file naming, structure, dependencies) for each layer
  - Investigate reasons for any exceptional patterns

### 2. Before Writing Tests
- Identify which architectural layer the code belongs to
- Confirm test strategy for that layer from guidelines
- **Review ALL existing test files in the same layer**:
  - File naming conventions
  - Build tag usage patterns
  - Directory placement
- Extract patterns by examining multiple files (minimum 3)
- Never rely on a single example

### 3. Checklist Before Creating New Files
- [ ] Reviewed all existing files in the same directory
- [ ] Extracted naming convention patterns
- [ ] Verified consistency with guidelines
- [ ] Understood reasons for any exceptional patterns
